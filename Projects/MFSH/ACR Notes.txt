Currently I take all the possible codeâ€™s and put them into one CodeSystem, and reference that code system in each valueset.

For example:
CodeSystem: RadLexCDE
Title: "RadLex CDE's"
* ^hierarchyMeaning = #is-a


Cyst Notes

The CDR defines RDE1575 (cyst), which has 4 possible values (present, absent...)

In fhir...
I am using the code RDE1575 as the code that identifies the observation as a cyst observation.
I then am adding a component that defines the presence codes (absent...). To identify the component, I use the same code (RDE1575).
This means that I am using RDE1575 for two different things. Their purpose is defined clearly in context, but it feels wrong to
use the same code in both places.

Would it make sense to make RDE1575 have no values, and add a new child element of RDE1575 that has the four presence items in it.

This element could also be reused in all the other abnormalities.

Should "RDE1577 Type" be renamed to "RDE1577 Cyst Type"

Should "RDE1578 Density" be renamed to "RDE1578 Lesion Density"

Can we add a set for Tumour Satelite?

Can we add a set Observed Changes?

I dont see any elements for the actual birads scores. Are they published? Did I miss this?

Thats it for today!

Best,
Kurt A.
