Cyst Notes

The CDR defines RDE1575 (cyst), which has 4 possible values (present, absent...)

In fhir...
I am using the code RDE1575 as the code that identifies the observation as a cyst observation.
I then am adding a component that defines the presence codes (absent...). To identify the component, I use the same code (RDE1575).
THis means that I am using Code1575 for two different things. Their purpose is defined clearly in context, but it feels wrong to
use the same code in both places.

Would it make sense to make RDE1575 have no values, and add a new code that has the four presence items in it. This could also be reused 
in all the other abnormalities.

Should "RDE1577 Type" be renamed to "RDE1577 Cyst Type"
